# PreCookedParticles

Its the essential script to work with particles in Js
to do some stuff like ~_LineAndPArticles animation_~ or ~_ParticlesInFloorGravity_~

## Why?

Im going to do more of this "animations" and I dont want to rewrite it again and again...
so i took the base of the project and put it here
